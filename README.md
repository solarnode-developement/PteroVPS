# PteroVPS | forked @ ysdragon

⚠️ This project isn't completey ours - credits to *ysdragon* for the original backend.

📌 This is a modified fork of his Pterodactyl VPS Egg, tweaked a bit and updated for our usage.

## Overview

This is the Public Egg for Solarnode's Ptero VPS.
If your not interested in using this egg you can always purchase one of our prebuilt servers for a relatively affordable price at solarnode.xyz

## Features
- Linux OS Selection (10+ Available Distros)
- Incredibly Lightweight
- Could be compatible with SSH/SMTP (IDK)
- Free
- Port Selection

and yeah that's basically it for now

## Installation & Usage
> [!NOTE]  
> In order to use this egg, you need Pterodactyl Panel running on one of your servers.
> If not installed - I recommend you do so if you plan to utilise this egg (pterodactyl.io)

- [1] Download the 'pterovpsegg.json' from above.
- [2] Login to your pterodactyl panel.
- [3] Go to Nests > Import Egg and import the recently-downloaded .json file.
- [4] Create a server using the egg you just imported.
- [5] Run through the simple installation process with your console.
- [6] Start the server and then your VPS should be ready

*You can tweak the settings and variables accordingly however you like, just make sure you don't break anything.*
